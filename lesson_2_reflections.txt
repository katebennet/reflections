1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Don't know.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory = what you're working on, not saved to the cloud.
Staging area = saved to the cloud, safer in case lose the file, others can look at it.
Repository = checked in, impacting the main code line.
